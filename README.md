I'm passionate about technology, innovation, and digital experiences. Throughout my career, I've focused on developing scalable, secure, and efficient solutions, with a practical and innovative approach.

I have solid experience in backend development using .NET/C#, building high-performance and easily scalable applications. I leverage DevOps methodologies for automating pipelines and continuous integration, using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, GitLab CI/CD, and Terraform to ensure an agile and efficient development process. I work extensively with AWS, Azure, and GCP, managing cloud infrastructures that prioritize high availability and scalability.

As an enthusiast in AI engineering, I focus on autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs). I use frameworks like LangChain and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to develop intelligent, contextual solutions that optimize processes and improve operational efficiency. My expertise extends to integrating AI into cloud computing systems and implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC), building innovative solutions aligned with business needs.
